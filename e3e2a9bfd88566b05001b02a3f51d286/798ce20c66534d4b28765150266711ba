# Transaction & Lock

### Transaction

Transaction mechanism provides block-like syntax:

```crystal
Jennifer::Adapter.default_adapter.transaction do |tx|
  Contact.create({:name => "Chose", :age => 20})
end
```

If any error was raised in block transaction will be rollbacked. To rollback transaction raise `DB::Rollback` exception.

Transaction lock connection for current fiber avoiding grepping new one from pool.

### Lock

#### Row level

Provides support for row-level locking using `SELECT â€¦ FOR UPDATE` and other lock types.

Chain `#find` to `#lock` to obtain an exclusive lock on the selected rows:

```crystal
# select * from contacts where id=1 for update
Contact.all.lock.find(1)
```

You can also use `Jennifer::Model::Base#lock!` method to lock one record by id. This may be better if you don't need to lock every row. Example:

```crystal
Contact.transaction do
  # select * from contacts where ...
  contacts = Contact.where { _age > 15 }.to_a
  contact = contacts.find { |c| c.name =~ /John/ }.not_nil!
  contact.lock!
  contact.age += 10
  contact.save!
end
```

You can start a transaction and acquire the lock in one go by calling with_lock with a block. The block is called from within a transaction, the object is already locked. Example:

```crystal
contact = Contact.first!
contact.with_lock do
  # This block is called within a transaction,
  # record is already locked.
  contact.age += 100
  contact.save!
end
```

#### Table level

To lock table use `Jennifer::Adapter#with_table_lock` method

```crystal
Jennifer::Adapter.default_adapter("table_name") do
  # some operations here
end
```

Or performing directly on model class:

```crystal
Contact.with_table_lock do
  # some operations here
end
```

> But **only** postgres adapter supports the real table `LOCK` statement - mysql one just wraps a call to the transaction. This is caused by performing queries with prepared statements and mysql doesn't allow lock table via it.
