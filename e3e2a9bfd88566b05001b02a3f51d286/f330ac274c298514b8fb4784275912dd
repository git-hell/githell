# Relations

There are 4 types of relations: `has_many`, `has_and_belongs_to_many`, `belongs_to` and `has_one`. All of them have same semantic but generate slightly different methods.

They takes next arguments:

- `name` - relation name
- `klass` - target class
- `request` - additional request (will be used inside of where clause) - optional
- `foreign` - name of foreign key - optional; by default use singularized table name + "_id"
- `primary` - primary field name - optional;  by default it uses default primary field of class.

has_and_belongs_to_many also accepts extra 2 arguments and use regular arguments slightly in another way:

- `join_table` - join table name; be default relation table names in alphabetic order joined by underscore is used
- `join_foreign` - foreign key for current model (left foreign key of join table)
- `foreign` - used as right foreign key
- `primary` - used as primary field of current table; for now it properly works only if both models in this relation has primary field named `id`

All relation macros provide next methods:

- `#{{relation_name}}` - cache relation object (or array of them) and returns it;
- `#{{relation_name}}_reload` - reload relation and returns it;
- `#{{relation_name}}_query` - returns query which is used to get objects of this object relation entities form db.
- `#remove_{{relation_name}}` - removes given object from relation
- `#add_{{relation_name}}` - adds given object to relation or builds it from hash and then adds

This allows dynamically adds objects to relations with automatically setting foreign id:

```crystal
contact = Contact.all.find!
contact.add_addresses({:main => true, :street => "some street", :details => nil})

address = contact.addresses.last
contact.remove_addresses(address)
```

`belongs_to` and `has_one` add extra method `#relation_name!` which also adds assertion for `nil` inside of it.

`%has_and_belongs_to_many` relation allows to define many-to-many relationship between 2 models. By given parameters could be specified field names described on the next schema:

```text
| "Model A" |   | "Join Table" (join_table) |       | "Model B"               |
| --------- |   |---------------------------|       |-------------------------|
| primary   |<--| foreign                   |   /-->| "model b primary field" |
                | association_foreign       |--/
```

As you can see primary field of related model can't be specified - defined primary key (in the mapping) will be got.

Also `has_many`, `belongs_to` and `has_one` relations have `dependent` parameter - defines extra callback for cleaning up related data after destroying parent one. Allowed types are:

- `nullify` - sets foreign key to `null` (`belongs_to` doesn't support it) - default for `has_many` and `has_one`
- `delete` - deletes all related objects
- `destroy` - destroys all related objects
- `restrict_with_exception` - will raise `Jennifer::RecordExists` exception if there is any related object
- `none` - will do nothing - default for `belongs_to`

## Inverse of

`has_many` and `has_one` relations also accepts `inverse_of` option which presents inverse relation name. Specifying this option will automatically load owner object during any relation loading (because of `ModelQuery#includes` or `ModelQuery#eager_load` or even plaint `SomeModel#relation_name` method call).

## Polymorphic Relations

Polymorphic relation can be easily configured:

```crystal
class Photo < Jennifer::Model::Base
  mapping(
    # ...
    attachable_type: String?,
    attachable_id: int32?
  )

  # klass options specifies the exact union of models allowed to use this one
  belongs_to :attachable, Union(Post | Comment), polymorphic: true
end

class Post < Jennifer::Model::Base
  # ...

  # The :inverse_of option here specifies the polymorphic interface and is required
  has_many :photos, Photo, polymorphic: true, inverse_of: :attachable
end
```

This works by using a type column in addition to a foreign key to specify the associated record. In the `Photo` example, you'd need an `attachable_id` integer column and an `attachable_type` string column.

**Important restriction**: Polymorphic belongs_to relation can't be loaded dynamically. E.g., based on the previous example:

```crystal
Photo.all.includes(:attachable) # This is forbidden
# and
photo.attachable_query # => Jennifer::QueryBuilder::Query instead of Jennifer::QueryBuilder::ModelQuery
```
