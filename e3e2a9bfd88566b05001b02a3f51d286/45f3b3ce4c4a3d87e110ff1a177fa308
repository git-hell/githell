# Eager Loading

As was said Jennifer provide lazy query evaluation so it will be performed only after invoking executing method. Here is a list of all executing methods:

- `#last` - returns last found record or `nil` if nothing was found;
- `#last!` - returns last record or raise `RecordNotFound` if nothing was found;
- `#first` - returns first found record or `nil` if nothing was found;
- `#first!` - returns first record or raise `RecordNotFound` if nothing was found;
- `#pluck` - returns array of specified fields values instead of records;
- `#delete` - deletes all records in db by query;
- `#exists?` - checks if there is any record in DB that fits query;
- `#update` - updates fields by given values;
- `#modify` - modify fields by given values using specified operators;
- `#increment` - increments fields by given values;
- `#decrement` - decrements fields by given values;
- `#to_a` - calls `#results`;
- `#db_results` - returns array of hashes found by query execution;
- `#results` - returns array of results found by query execution;
- `#ids` - plucks `id` field and converts it to the `Int32`;
- `#each` - calls `#to_a` and yields each object;
- `#each_result_set` - perform request and yield each result set;
- `#find_in_batches` - retrieves from db result sets of given size and yields them;
- `#find_each` - same as `#find_in_batches` but yields each result instead of array;
- `#find_records_by_sql` - returns array of `Jennifer::Record` found by given plain SQL request;
- `#destroy` - invokes `#to_a` and calls `#destroy` on each record`.

`#pluck` returns array of values if only one field was given and array of arrays otherwise. By default it uses scope of current table (e.g. in previous example select clause included `contacts.id`). To allow grepping custom fields or any statement you need to specify custom select clause:

```crystal
Contact.all.select("COUNT(id) as count, contacts.name").group("name")
       .having { sql("COUNT(id)") > 1 }.pluck(:count)
```

## Relation Eager Loading

To prevent N+1 problem you may want to automatically load some related objects. There 3 possible ways how to do this:

- using `#eager_load` - will automatically join all provided relations using `LEFT OUTER JOIN`;
- using `#relation` (or manual joining) + `#with` - works as `#eager_load` but allows you to manipulate loaded records;
- using `#includes`/`#preload` - will load all specified relations using separate requests.

Examples:

```crystal
# #eager_load
Contact.all.eager_load(:addresses)

# manual eager load
Contact.all.left_join(Address) { _contacts__id == _contact_id }.with_relation(:addresses)

# #includes/#preload
Contact.all.includes(:addresses)
# or
Contact.all.preload(:addresses)
```

> NOTE: `#preload` is just an alias for `#includes`.

Also `#eager_load` and `#includes` accepts splatted named tuple as last arguments specifying nested relations to load:

```crystal
City.all.eager_load(country: { contact: [:passport, :addresses]})
```
