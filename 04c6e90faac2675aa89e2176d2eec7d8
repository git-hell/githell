# [Is This Waifu Legal](https://yourwaifu.dev/is-your-waifu-legal/)

# FAQ

## How do waifus have 18th birthdays? do they age?

Well it depends on the anime and the waifu in question.

## If a waifu turns 18 in the show, what would happen if you fapped to the wrong season?

[This happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08vk9g-jcsM)

## Were we supposed to not fap before?

It's the same answer to this question, Is it illegal to fap to underage fictional characters? I'll let you decide that for yourself.

## Is this a joke?

Yea

## Why not just look it up on Google?

Many wiki sites have info on this stuff, but you have to read through a bunch of other info to figure out the current age, the age in the show, and what season and ep they've become of legal age, and how mature they act. This site is one place with all the age data and information about anime girl ages.
