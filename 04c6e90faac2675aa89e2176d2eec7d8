# the diary

the diary is a collaborative writing project. uesrs can submit their own diary entries, and every 24 hours, one will be chosen at random. over 
time, these entries will begin to form a personality and traits for a character writing the diary, and eventually the project will ideally be
a full-on first-person narrative.
