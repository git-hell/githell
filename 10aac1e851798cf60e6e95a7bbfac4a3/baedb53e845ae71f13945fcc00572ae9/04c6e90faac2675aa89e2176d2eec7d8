## [Optional] Description

**[Give a more detailed description of the container if the summary does not provide enough info.]**

## Using this definition with an existing folder

**[Optional] Include any special setup requirements here. For example:**

While the definition itself works unmodified, you can select the version of **YOUR RUNTIME HERE** the container uses by updating the `VARIANT` arg in the included `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` file.

```yaml
args:
  VARIANT: buster
```

### Adding another service

You can add other services to your `docker-compose.yml` file [as described in Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#service-configuration-reference). However, if you want anything running in this service to be available in the container on localhost, or want to forward the service locally, be sure to add this line to the service config:

```yaml
# Runs the service on the same network as the app container, allows "forwardPorts" in devcontainer.json function.
network_mode: service:app
```

### Adding the definition to your project
