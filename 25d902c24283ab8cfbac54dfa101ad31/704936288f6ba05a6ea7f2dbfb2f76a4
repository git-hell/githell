# Quine Relay

[![CI](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

## What this is

This is a <%= RunSteps[0].name %> program that generates
<%= RunSteps[1].name %> program that generates
<%= RunSteps[2].name %> program that generates
...(through <%= RunSteps.size %> languages in total)...
<%= RunSteps[-1].name %> program that generates
the original <%= RunSteps[0].name %> code again.

![Language Uroboros][langs]

[langs]: langs.png

(If you want to see the old 50-language version, see [50](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay/tree/50) branch.)

## Usage

### Ubuntu

If you are using Ubuntu <%= `bash -c 'source /etc/os-release && echo $VERSION'`.chomp %>, you can perform the following steps.

#### 1. Install all interpreters/compilers.

First, you have to type the following apt-get command to install all of them.

    $ <%= apt_get %>

Then, build the bundled interpreters.

    $ sudo apt-get install <%= other_packages.join(" ") %>
    $ make -C vendor

#### 2. Run each program on each interpreter/compiler.

    $ ulimit -s unlimited
% cmds.each do |cmd|
    $ <%= cmd %>
% end

You will see that `QR.rb` is the same as `QR2.rb`.

    $ diff QR.rb QR2.rb

Alternatively, just type `make`.

    $ make

Note: It may require huge memory to compile some files.

### Docker

Simply build the image and run a container as follows:

    $ docker build -t qr .
    $ docker run --privileged --rm -e CI=true qr

Note: you need to run in privileged mode otherwise the `maxima` command will fail.

If you want to check generated files, you can mount the local directory in the Docker container (but keep using the `vendor` directory of the container), as follows:

    $ docker run --privileged --rm -e CI=true -v $(pwd):/usr/local/share/quine-relay -v /usr/local/share/quine-relay/vendor qr

### Other platforms

You may find [instructions for other platforms in the wiki](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay/wiki/Installation).

If you are not using these Linux distributions, please find your way yourself.
If you could do it, please let me know.  Good luck.

## Tested interpreter/compiler versions

I used the following Ubuntu deb packages to test this program.

% rows.each do |row|
<%= row %>
% end

Note that some languages are not available in Ubuntu (marked as *N/A*).
This repository includes their implementations in `vendor/`.
See also `vendor/README` in detail.


## Frequently asked questions

### Q. Why?

A. [Take your pick](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay/issues/11).

### Q. How?

A. Good news: I published a book, ["The world of obfuscated, esoteric, artistic programming"](http://gihyo.jp/book/2015/978-4-7741-7643-7).
It explains how to write a quine, an ascii-art quine, and a uroboros quine like this quine-relay.
You can buy my book on [amazon.co.jp](http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4774176435).

(It also contains my almost all (about forty) works, including
[alphabet-only Ruby program](http://www.slideshare.net/mametter/ruby-esoteric-obfuscated-ruby-programming-5088683),
[radiation-hardened quine](https://github.com/mame/radiation-hardened-quine),
etc., and explains many techniques to write such programs.)

Bad news: It is written in Japanese.
I hope you could translate it to English <strike>and help me earn royalties</strike>.

### Q. Language XXX is missing!

A. See [the criteria for language inclusion][criteria] in detail.  (In short: please create a deb package and contribute it to Ubuntu.)

See also [:heart:][sponsors].

### Q. Does it really work?

A. [![CI](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay/actions?query=workflow%2ACI)

### Q. How long did it take you?

A. [Do you try to cross the world line?](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay/issues/60)

### Q. The code does not fit into my display!

A. [Here you go][thumbnail].

[thumbnail]: thumbnail.png

### Q. How was the code generated?

A.

    $ sudo apt-get install rake ruby-cairo ruby-rsvg2 ruby-gdk-pixbuf2 \
      optipng advancecomp ruby-chunky-png
    $ cd src
    $ rake2.0 clobber
    $ rake2.0
