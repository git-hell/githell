    <p>
        when you write software, it is credited to you. you own it.
        when people look at it, they will find it on your account,
        your profile, whatever - it has your name attached. what if
        it didn't? git hell is a small experiment in that. git
        repos are pulled in from github, the filenames hashed, and
        they are pushed to one communal git repo. your name is gone.
        and your code is probably broken too. give it a try. type
        a git repo below and press the button. you can find all the
        'code' <a href="https://github.com/git-hell/githell">here</a>.
