    <h1>the diary</h1>
    <h3>a collaborative, open to the public writing project</h3>
    <p>
        users can submit their own diary entries, ideally in-character for the person the diary seems to describe. every 24 hours, a new entry
        will be chosen at random and added to the list. new entries can build off of the existing ones to ideally over time create a public
        profile of a hypothetical writer. if you are interested in contributing regularly, check out <a href="https://discord.gg/NcrAgHPmWm">the discord</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        if that description was confusing, think of it like this:
        there is a person, in some universe, writing a diary. we don't know them or anything aobut them or where they are.
        they write entries and post them here, and we read them and learn about them.
        the entries are by them, from their perspective, about them and their world.
        the catch is this: they don't physically write the entries. we do. we write as them, based on what we know about them, and that teaches us more about them.
    </p>
    <p>
        this means, and i cannot stress this enough,
        NO JOKE ENTRIES. NO SPAM. it is not funny,
        and you're making the project less fun and less interesting for everyone. any spam/joke entries will be deleted. you can joke and spam anywhere you like,
        on your own time: the diary is a specific place with a specific purpose.
